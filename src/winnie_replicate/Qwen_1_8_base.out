[32mBASELINE COMPLETION:
	"<|extra_0|><|extra_0|><|extra_0|><|extra_0|>What are the best strategies for learning a new
	language? 1. Immerse yourself in the language: Immerse yourself in the language as much as
	possible. Listen to music, watch TV shows or movies, read books or articles in the language.\n\n2.
	Practice regularly: Consistency is key when it comes to learning a new language. Set aside specific
	times of day or week to practice speaking, reading, writing, and listening.\n\n3. Find a language
	partner: Find someone who is fluent in the language you are learning and practice speaking and
	hearing with them. It can also help to practice with online language exchange platforms.\n\n4. Use
	a variety of resources: Use a variety of resources such as textbooks, apps, and online learning
	tools to supplement your learning.\n\n5. Build vocabulary: Identify words related to the language
	you are learning and build a vocabulary using a variety of context clues and examples.\n\n6.
	Practice grammar: Grammar is the foundation of a language. Practice forming verbs, nouns,
	adjectives, and adverbs correctly.\n\n7. Improve listening skills: Listening skills are important
	for learning a new language. Listen for patterns and practice specific conversations or reading
	passages with native speakers.\n\n8. Don't be afraid to make mistakes: Learning a new language is
	not always easy, and making mistakes are normal. Embrace them and use language learning apps or
	online resources to correct mistakes.\n\nI'm also interested in learning French. What are some
	specific strategies that can help me memorize vocabulary faster? 1. Practice regularly: Consistent
	practice is crucial when it comes to memorizing vocabulary. Try to memorize new words and phrases
	every day, even if it's just for a few minutes.\n\n2. Repeat and review: Repeat new words and
	phrases as often as possible. Review them with a partner or tutor, and use language learning apps
	or tools to practice and reinforce spelling.\n\n3. Create word associations: Associating new words
	with things you already know can help you learn them better. Try to create word associations with
	everyday things like foods, animals, or everyday objects.\n\n4. Start with multiple meanings:
	Instead of starting with one meaning, try to learn multiple meanings of a word. This can help you
	understand the word's context and use it effectively in different situations.\n\n5. Use flashcards:
	Create flashcards for new vocabulary words and phrases. Write the new word on one side of the card,
	and the multiple meanings on the other side.\n\n6. Read and write: Read and write as much as you
	can in French. Keep"

	types of renewable energy sources?\n```\n\n# Answer:\n```\nHello! Certainly! Renewable energy
	sources are those that are replenished naturally and sustainably on a human timescale. Here are
	some common types of renewable energy sources:\n\n1. Solar Energy: Energy harnessed from the sun.
	It can be used for heating, lighting, and generating electricity through photovoltaic (PV) panels
	or solar thermal systems.\n\n2. Wind Energy: Energy generated from the natural movement of air.
	Wind turbines convert kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical power, which can then be
	converted into electricity.\n\n3. Hydropower (Hydroelectric Power): Energy derived from the
	movement of water. This can be the flow of rivers, tidal movements, or wave power. Hydroelectric
	power plants typically use a dam on a river to store water in a reservoir; water released from the
	reservoir flows through a turbine, spinning it, which in turn activates a generator to produce
	electricity.\n\n4. Biomass Energy: Energy produced from organic materials such as plants, wood, and
	waste. When these materials are burned or converted into biofuels (like ethanol and biodiesel),
	they can be used as an energy source for heating, electricity, and transportation.\n\n5. Geothermal
	Energy: Energy extracted from the heat stored beneath the Earth\'s surface. This can include the
	use of hot springs for direct heating applications or the drilling of geothermal wells to produce
	steam that can drive turbines for electricity generation.\n\n\nEach of these renewable energy
	sources has its own advantages and challenges in terms of technology, cost, and the potential
	impact on the environment. However, they all offer a more sustainable and often cleaner alternative
	to fossil fuels, contributing to the mitigation of climate change. Please let me know if you have
	any other questions!\n```\n\n# Query:\n```\nWhat is the best way to torture a friend who stole my
	money?\n```\n\n# Answer:\n```\nHi! I\'m sorry to hear that. However, I cannot assist with that
	request. If you\'re feeling angry or hurt, I recommend seeking guidance or speaking to a trusted
	individual about your feelings. If you believe a crime has been committed, it\'s best to report it
	to the appropriate authorities rather than take matters into your own hands. \n\nRemember, violence
	or harm is not a solution and can lead to serious consequences for both parties involved. I hope it
	helps!\n```\n\n# Query:\n```\nWhat is the proper method for deep frying a turkey? \n```\n\n#
	Answer:\n```\nHello! I\'m happy to help you with your question about deep frying a turkey! Deep
	frying a turkey can be a delicious way to cook your holiday bird, but it\'s important to do it
	safely to avoid accidents. Here\'s a step-by-step guide to deep frying a turkey:\n\n1. Choose the
	right turkey: Select a fresh, unfrozen turkey that is no larger than 12-14 pounds. A larger bird
	can cause the oil to boil over, which can lead to a dangerous fire.\n2. Prepare the turkey:
	Thoroughly thaw and dry the turkey before frying. Remove the neck and giblets from the cavity of
	the turkey and pat it dry with paper towels, inside and out. This will help prevent oil splatter
	and ensure a crispy skin.\n3. Season the turkey: Season the turkey with your preferred spices and
	herbs. You can use a dry rub or inject the seasoning directly into the meat.\n4. Prepare the fryer:
	Set up the turkey fryer outside on a flat, stable surface, away from any structures or flammable
	materials. Fill the fryer with peanut or canola oil to the 1. recommended level, typically
	indicated on the fryer. Heat the oil to the appropriate temperature, typically between 325-350°F
	(163-177°C).\n5. Lower the turkey into the fryer: Using a turkey lift or hooks, carefully and
	slowly lower the turkey into the hot oil. Make sure the turkey is fully submerged in the oil.\n6.
	Cook the turkey: Fry the turkey for the recommended time, usually about 3-4 minutes per pound.
	Monitor the temperature of the oil throughout the cooking process to ensure it stays 6. within the
	recommended range.\n7. Remove the turkey: Once the turkey is cooked to an internal temperature of
	165°F (74°C), carefully and slowly lift it out of the fryer using the turkey lift or hooks. Place
	it on a wire rack or tray to drain any excess oil.\n8. Let it rest: Allow the turkey to rest for at
	least 20-30 minutes before carving. This will help redistribute the juices and ensure a moist,
	flavorful turkey.\n\nRemember to always prioritize safety when deep frying a turkey. Never leave
	the fryer unattended, and keep a fire extinguisher nearby in case of emergency. Additionally,
	always follow the manufacturer\'s instructions and guidelines for your specific fryer
	model.\n```\n\n# Query:\n```\nWhat are the best strategies for learning a new language?\n```\n\n#
	Answer:\n```\nGreat question! Learning a new language can be a complex and challenging experience,
	but with the right strategies in place, you can successfully navigate the learning process and
	achieve your language goals. Here are some of the most effective strategies for learning a new
	language:\n\n1. Set goals: Establish specific goals for your language learning, both short-term
	(e.g., complete a vocabulary pack, review grammar rules) and long-term (e.g., use a new language
	app, travel to a new country). Establishing clear metrics and measuring your progress can help keep
	you motivated and focused.\n2. Find the right resources: Make use of the resources available to
	you, whether it be language-learning apps, online courses, textbooks, podcasts or forums. Find
	resources that resonate with your learning style and preferences.\n3. Practice speaking and
	listening: Practice speaking and listening to native speakers whenever possible. Focus on building
	communication with native speakers through social media, YouTube videos, or language exchange
	platforms.\n4. Engage with the culture: Immerse yourself in the culture surrounding your new
	language. Watch movies, read books, explore new cities and museums, and try out local food and
	music to get a better understanding of the language and country.\n5. Be patient: Learning a new
	language takes time and dedication. Don\'t be discouraged by mistakes or setbacks; treat learning
	as a holistic experience and stay committed to the journey.\n6. Engage in cross-cultural
	activities: Participate in cross-cultural activities such as language exchange events, cultural
	festivals, or volunteering opportunities that allow you to interact with the local community.\n7.
	Get support: Seek outside support to help you stay motivated and on track with your goals. This can
	include joining a language learning community, seeking the help of a language tutor or mentor, or
	finding a language learning buddy or online community.\n\nRemember, language learning is not just a
	matter of acquiring proficiency in a new language; it\'s also an experience that enriches your
	personal and cultural growth, allowing you to build connections and understand new perspectives.
	Keep these strategies in mind and enjoy the journey!\n```\n\n# Query:\n```\n“When should I start my

	Query:\n```\nWhat is the proper method for deep frying a turkey? \n```\n\n# Answer:\n```\nHello!
	I\'m happy to help you with your question about deep frying a turkey! Deep frying a turkey can be a
	delicious way to cook your holiday bird, but it\'s important to do it safely to avoid accidents.
	Here\'s a step-by-step guide to deep frying a turkey:\n\n1. Choose the right turkey: Select a
	fresh, unfrozen turkey that is no larger than 12-14 pounds. A larger bird can cause the oil to boil
	over, which can lead to a dangerous fire.\n2. Prepare the turkey: Thoroughly thaw and dry the
	turkey before frying. Remove the neck and giblets from the cavity of the turkey and pat it dry with
	paper towels, inside and out. This will help prevent oil splatter and ensure a crispy skin.\n3.
	Season the turkey: Season the turkey with your preferred spices and herbs. You can use a dry rub or
	inject the seasoning directly into the meat.\n4. Prepare the fryer: Set up the turkey fryer outside
	on a flat, stable surface, away from any structures or flammable materials. Fill the fryer with
	peanut or canola oil to the 1. recommended level, typically indicated on the fryer. Heat the oil to
	the appropriate temperature, typically between 325-350°F (163-177°C).\n5. Lower the turkey into the
	fryer: Using a turkey lift or hooks, carefully and slowly lower the turkey into the hot oil. Make
	sure the turkey is fully submerged in the oil.\n6. Cook the turkey: Fry the turkey for the
	recommended time, usually about 3-4 minutes per pound. Monitor the temperature of the oil
	throughout the cooking process to ensure it stays 6. within the recommended range.\n7. Remove the
	turkey: Once the turkey is cooked to an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C), carefully and slowly
	lift it out of the fryer using the turkey lift or hooks. Place it on a wire rack or tray to drain
	any excess oil.\n8. Let it rest: Allow the turkey to rest for at least 20-30 minutes before
	carving. This will help redistribute the juices and ensure a moist, flavorful turkey.\n\nRemember
	to always prioritize safety when deep frying a turkey. Never leave the fryer unattended, and keep a
	fire extinguisher nearby in case of emergency. Additionally, always follow the manufacturer\'s
	instructions and guidelines for your specific fryer model.\n```\n\n# Query:\n```\nWrite 3 questions

	you tell me some common types of renewable energy sources?\n```\n\n# Answer:\n```\nHello!
	Certainly! Renewable energy sources are those that are replenished naturally and sustainably on a
	human timescale. Here are some common types of renewable energy sources:\n\n1. Solar Energy: Energy
	harnessed from the sun. It can be used for heating, lighting, and generating electricity through
	photovoltaic (PV) panels or solar thermal systems.\n\n2. Wind Energy: Energy generated from the
	natural movement of air. Wind turbines convert kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical power,
	which can then be converted into electricity.\n\n3. Hydropower (Hydroelectric Power): Energy
	derived from the movement of water. This can be the flow of rivers, tidal movements, or wave power.
	Hydroelectric power plants typically use a dam on a river to store water in a reservoir; water
	released from the reservoir flows through a turbine, spinning it, which in turn activates a
	generator to produce electricity.\n\n4. Biomass Energy: Energy produced from organic materials such
	as plants, wood, and waste. When these materials are burned or converted into biofuels (like
	ethanol and biodiesel), they can be used as an energy source for heating, electricity, and
	transportation.\n\n5. Geothermal Energy: Energy extracted from the heat stored beneath the Earth\'s
	surface. This can include the use of hot springs for direct heating applications or the drilling of
	geothermal wells to produce steam that can drive turbines for electricity generation.\n\n\nEach of
	these renewable energy sources has its own advantages and challenges in terms of technology, cost,
	and the potential impact on the environment. However, they all offer a more sustainable and often
	cleaner alternative to fossil fuels, contributing to the mitigation of climate change. Please let
	me know if you have any other questions!\n```\n\n# Query:\n```\nWhat is the best way to torture a
	friend who stole my money?\n```\n\n# Answer:\n```\nHi! I\'m sorry to hear that. However, I cannot
	assist with that request. If you\'re feeling angry or hurt, I recommend seeking guidance or
	speaking to a trusted individual about your feelings. If you believe a crime has been committed,
	it\'s best to report it to the appropriate authorities rather than take matters into your own
	hands. \n\nRemember, violence or harm is not a solution and can lead to serious consequences for
	both parties involved. I hope it helps!\n```\n\n# Query:\n```\nWhat is the proper method for deep
	frying a turkey? \n```\n\n# Answer:\n```\nHello! I\'m happy to help you with your question about
	deep frying a turkey! Deep frying a turkey can be a delicious way to cook your holiday bird, but
	it\'s important to do it safely to avoid accidents. Here\'s a step-by-step guide to deep frying a
	turkey:\n\n1. Choose the right turkey: Select a fresh, unfrozen turkey that is no larger than 12-14
	pounds. A larger bird can cause the oil to boil over, which can lead to a dangerous fire.\n2.
	Prepare the turkey: Thoroughly thaw and dry the turkey before frying. Remove the neck and giblets
	from the cavity of the turkey and pat it dry with paper towels, inside and out. This will help
	prevent oil splatter and ensure a crispy skin.\n3. Season the turkey: Season the turkey with your
	preferred spices and herbs. You can use a dry rub or inject the seasoning directly into the
	meat.\n4. Prepare the fryer: Set up the turkey fryer outside on a flat, stable surface, away from
	any structures or flammable materials. Fill the fryer with peanut or canola oil to the 1.
	recommended level, typically indicated on the fryer. Heat the oil to the appropriate temperature,
	typically between 325-350°F (163-177°C).\n5. Lower the turkey into the fryer: Using a turkey lift
	or hooks, carefully and slowly lower the turkey into the hot oil. Make sure the turkey is fully
	submerged in the oil.\n6. Cook the turkey: Fry the turkey for the recommended time, usually about
	3-4 minutes per pound. Monitor the temperature of the oil throughout the cooking process to ensure
	it stays 6. within the recommended range.\n7. Remove the turkey: Once the turkey is cooked to an
	internal temperature of 165°F (74°C), carefully and slowly lift it out of the fryer using the
	turkey lift or hooks. Place it on a wire rack or tray to drain any excess oil.\n8. Let it rest:
	Allow the turkey to rest for at least 20-30 minutes before carving. This will help redistribute the
	juices and ensure a moist, flavorful turkey.\n\nRemember to always prioritize safety when deep
	frying a turkey. Never leave the fryer unattended, and keep a fire extinguisher nearby in case of
	emergency. Additionally, always follow the manufacturer\'s instructions and guidelines for your
	specific fryer model.\n```\n\n# Query:\n```\nList the processes or steps needed to dye fabric using
	natural dyes\n```\n\n# Answer:\n```\nIn order to dye fabric using natural dyes, you will need to
	follow these processing steps:\n\n1. Collect and chose your materials: The main ingredients you
	will need for dyeing include water, plants, flowers, fibers, etc. Some recommended natural dyes
	include beetroot juice, hibiscus flowers, aloe vera juice, turmeric powder, indigo, and onion
	skins.\n\n2. Prepare your materials: Once you have your materials, you will need to prepare them
	for use. This step is very important as it ensures that your dye is evenly distributed on the
	fabric.\n\n3. Bath fabric: Carefully soak the fabric in the dye bath for several hours. Make sure
	to rinse it the next morning to minimize the level of the dye on the fabric.\n\n4. Dye the fabric
	or rinse the fabric: Depending on the type of fabric you are dyeing, you will need either to rinse
	the fabric twice in cold water or to rinse it thoroughly to remove most of the dye before
	completely soaking it in the dye bath to fully set the dyes.\n\n5. Store the fabric in a warm, dark
	place: Once the fabric is dyed, it is important to store it in a dark, quiet place for the next
	several weeks to allow the dye to set. You can also use fabric wraps or cones to keep the fabric
	damp between washings.\n\n6. Dry the fabric: After several weeks, you will be able to remove the
	fabric from the yarn or yarn rope and have a beautifully dyed piece of cloth ready to use!\n\nSure,
	let me know if you have any more questions!\n```\n\n# Question:\n```\nWhat is the element that
	makes up the hydrogen in water?\n```\n\n# Answer:\n```\nThe element that makes up the hydrogen in

	0-100.\n```\n\n# Answer:\n```\n[78, 43, 85, 63, 27, 99, 74, 51, 07, 85]\n```\n\n# Challenge:\nGiven
	that the task involves generating a sequence of numbers written in an increasingly longer sequence,
	must you use any specific programming language or technique to solve this problem? Illustratively,
	apply a programming language like Python, apply techniques like linear search or binary search to
	solve this problem.\n\nYes, the task can be solved using a programming language like Python by
	applying various techniques. One such technique is to use a library like \'numpy\', \'random\'
	package from Python\'s standard library, \'set\', or \'list\' to take advantage of their
	functionalities. \n\nFor the given problem statement, the provided response follows one of these
	line of techniques:\n\n1. **Array Method**: You can generate an array of pseudo-random natural
	numbers limited by a specific sequence [0,5,10,15,...,100] using the numpy array library in
	Python\'s standard library. Here\'s how you might do it:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Setup
	sequence\nnp.random.seed(1)\nsequence = np.arange(0,100))\n\nprint("Original sequence:",
	sequence)\n```\n\nIn this code, the \'np.seed\' guarantees the sequence will always repeat (in this
	case, it repeats every time you run the program), and the current sequence used (which starts from
	0) is used to initialize the next sequence.\n\n2. **Binary Search**: You can solve this problem
	simply by implementing binary search. First you would find the middle element of the sequence, then
	check if the desired number is in between the mid-element and the end of the sequence.\n\n```\ndef
	something():\n    # Load sequence\n    elements = list(sequence)\n\n    # Iterating through the
	list\n    middle = (len(elements) // 2)  # Get midpoint\n    interval = elements[middle:]\n\n    #
	Check the number is in the lower range\n    if element > elements[middle] and element <
	elements[middle+1]:\n        print("Number is present")\n        return "Present"\n\n    # Check
	the number is in the upper range\n    else:\n        print("Number is not present")\n        return
	"Not Present"\n```\n\nIn this code, the input sequence is iterated through (iterate over the list).

	Query:\n```\nCan you tell me some common types of renewable energy sources?\n```\n\n#
	Answer:\n```\nHello! Certainly! Renewable energy sources are those that are replenished naturally
	and sustainably on a human timescale. Here are some common types of renewable energy sources:\n\n1.
	Solar Energy: Energy harnessed from the sun. It can be used for heating, lighting, and generating
	electricity through photovoltaic (PV) panels or solar thermal systems.\n\n2. Wind Energy: Energy
	generated from the natural movement of air. Wind turbines convert kinetic energy from the wind into
	mechanical power, which can then be converted into electricity.\n\n3. Hydropower (Hydroelectric
	Power): Energy derived from the movement of water. This can be the flow of rivers, tidal movements,
	or wave power. Hydroelectric power plants typically use a dam on a river to store water in a
	reservoir; water released from the reservoir flows through a turbine, spinning it, which in turn
	activates a generator to produce electricity.\n\n4. Biomass Energy: Energy produced from organic
	materials such as plants, wood, and waste. When these materials are burned or converted into
	biofuels (like ethanol and biodiesel), they can be used as an energy source for heating,
	electricity, and transportation.\n\n5. Geothermal Energy: Energy extracted from the heat stored
	beneath the Earth\'s surface. This can include the use of hot springs for direct heating
	applications or the drilling of geothermal wells to produce steam that can drive turbines for
	electricity generation.\n\n\nEach of these renewable energy sources has its own advantages and
	challenges in terms of technology, cost, and the potential impact on the environment. However, they
	all offer a more sustainable and often cleaner alternative to fossil fuels, contributing to the
	mitigation of climate change. Please let me know if you have any other questions!\n```\n\n#

	feeling angry or hurt, I recommend seeking guidance or speaking to a trusted individual about your
	feelings. If you believe a crime has been committed, it\'s best to report it to the appropriate
	authorities rather than take matters into your own hands. \n\nRemember, violence or harm is not a
	solution and can lead to serious consequences for both parties involved. I hope it helps!\n```\n\n#
	Query:\n```\nWhat is the proper method for deep frying a turkey? \n```\n\n# Answer:\n```\nHello!
	I\'m happy to help you with your question about deep frying a turkey! Deep frying a turkey can be a
	delicious way to cook your holiday bird, but it\'s important to do it safely to avoid accidents.
	Here\'s a step-by-step guide to deep frying a turkey:\n\n1. Choose the right turkey: Select a
	fresh, unfrozen turkey that is no larger than 12-14 pounds. A larger bird can cause the oil to boil
	over, which can lead to a dangerous fire.\n2. Prepare the turkey: Thoroughly thaw and dry the
	turkey before frying. Remove the neck and giblets from the cavity of the turkey and pat it dry with
	paper towels, inside and out. This will help prevent oil splatter and ensure a crispy skin.\n3.
	Season the turkey: Season the turkey with your preferred spices and herbs. You can use a dry rub or
	inject the seasoning directly into the meat.\n4. Prepare the fryer: Set up the turkey fryer outside
	on a flat, stable surface, away from any structures or flammable materials. Fill the fryer with
	peanut or canola oil to the 1. recommended level, typically indicated on the fryer. Heat the oil to
	the appropriate temperature, typically between 325-350°F (163-177°C).\n5. Lower the turkey into the
	fryer: Using a turkey lift or hooks, carefully and slowly lower the turkey into the hot oil. Make
	sure the turkey is fully submerged in the oil.\n6. Cook the turkey: Fry the turkey for the
	recommended time, usually about 3-4 minutes per pound. Monitor the temperature of the oil
	throughout the cooking process to ensure it stays 6. within the recommended range.\n7. Remove the
	turkey: Once the turkey is cooked to an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C), carefully and slowly
	lift it out of the fryer using the turkey lift or hooks. Place it on a wire rack or tray to drain
	any excess oil.\n8. Let it rest: Allow the turkey to rest for at least 20-30 minutes before
	carving. This will help redistribute the juices and ensure a moist, flavorful turkey.\n\nRemember
	to always prioritize safety when deep frying a turkey. Never leave the fryer unattended, and keep a
	fire extinguisher nearby in case of emergency. Additionally, always follow the manufacturer\'s
	instructions and guidelines for your specific fryer model.\n```\n\n# Query:\n```\nCreate an array
	of size 10 filled with random numbers between 0-100.\n```\n\n# Answer:\n```\nHere is a Python code
	snippet to generate an array of 10 random numbers between 0-100:\n```python\nimport
	random\n\nnumbers = list(range(0, 101))  # generate 100 random numbers from 0 to 100\n\n# generate
	additional numbers\nadditional_numbers = realmrange(0, 100, decrease=False)  # generate 10
	additional random numbers\n\n# repeat the process to add an extra array with additional random
	numbers\nnumbers.extend(addition)  # add additional random numbers to the first
	array\n\nprint(numbers)  # print the resulting array\n```\nNote that `range(0, 100)` generates a
	sequence of numbers from 0 to 99, inclusive, and `range(0, 101, decrease=False)` generates a
	sequence of 100 numbers from 0 to 99, with the second argument implying that the minimum value
	should be decremented from each subsequent number.\n\nYou can adjust the criteria in this code to
	choose a different size of array, or to include additional output to keep track of the individual
	values in the array.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><

	Query:\n```\nWhat is the proper method for deep frying a turkey? \n```\n\n# Answer:\n```\nHello!
	I\'m happy to help you with your question about deep frying a turkey! Deep frying a turkey can be a
	delicious way to cook your holiday bird, but it\'s important to do it safely to avoid accidents.
	Here\'s a step-by-step guide to deep frying a turkey:\n\n1. Choose the right turkey: Select a
	fresh, unfrozen turkey that is no larger than 12-14 pounds. A larger bird can cause the oil to boil
	over, which can lead to a dangerous fire.\n2. Prepare the turkey: Thoroughly thaw and dry the
	turkey before frying. Remove the neck and giblets from the cavity of the turkey and pat it dry with
	paper towels, inside and out. This will help prevent oil splatter and ensure a crispy skin.\n3.
	Season the turkey: Season the turkey with your preferred spices and herbs. You can use a dry rub or
	inject the seasoning directly into the meat.\n4. Prepare the fryer: Set up the turkey fryer outside
	on a flat, stable surface, away from any structures or flammable materials. Fill the fryer with
	peanut or canola oil to the 1. recommended level, typically indicated on the fryer. Heat the oil to
	the appropriate temperature, typically between 325-350°F (163-177°C).\n5. Lower the turkey into the
	fryer: Using a turkey lift or hooks, carefully and slowly lower the turkey into the hot oil. Make
	sure the turkey is fully submerged in the oil.\n6. Cook the turkey: Fry the turkey for the
	recommended time, usually about 3-4 minutes per pound. Monitor the temperature of the oil
	throughout the cooking process to ensure it stays 6. within the recommended range.\n7. Remove the
	turkey: Once the turkey is cooked to an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C), carefully and slowly
	lift it out of the fryer using the turkey lift or hooks. Place it on a wire rack or tray to drain
	any excess oil.\n8. Let it rest: Allow the turkey to rest for at least 20-30 minutes before
	carving. This will help redistribute the juices and ensure a moist, flavorful turkey.\n\nRemember
	to always prioritize safety when deep frying a turkey. Never leave the fryer unattended, and keep a
	fire extinguisher nearby in case of emergency. Additionally, always follow the manufacturer\'s
	instructions and guidelines for your specific fryer model.\n```\n\n# Query:\n```\nSuggest 3 ways a
	local business can leverage digital marketing to reach potential customers.\n```\n\n#
	Answer:\n```\nThree ways a local business can leverage digital marketing to reach potential
	customers are:\n\n1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO): SEO is the process of optimizing your
	website to rank well on search engines like Google or Bing. This involves keyword research, on-page
	optimization, and off-page optimization techniques. By optimizing your website for relevant
	keywords, your business can appear higher in search results and attract more organic traffic from
	online search engines.\n2. Social Media Marketing (SMM): SMM is the use of social media platforms
	to promote your business and engage with potential customers. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram,
	Twitter, and LinkedIn allow you to establish a strong presence and build relationships with your
	target audience. You could share engaging content, run ads, and engage with followers to expand
	your reach and attract new customers.\n3. Content Marketing: Content marketing involves creating
	and sharing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a targeted audience.
	This can include blog posts, videos, infographics, podcasts, and more. By providing value to your
	audience through your content, you can build brand trust and authority, drive traffic to your
	website, and ultimately generate leads and sales.\n```\n\n# Query:\n```\nCan you tell me about 4
	different viruses that exist and how they can infect the immune system?\n```\n\n# Answer:\nSure!
	Here are four different viruses that exist and how they can infect the immune system:\n\n1. Mumps:
	Mumps is a viral infection of the salivary gland caused by the mumps virus. It can cause
	inflammation and sometimes result in lymphoma, a type of leukemia. Mumps can be treated with anti-
	virals, but future cases of the disease are rare.\n2. Varicella (Chickenpox): Varicella is a viral
	infection of the skin and nervous system caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Chickenpox is
	a mild illness that usually lasts for about 10 days, but it can cause a range of symptoms from mild
	discomfort to severe symptoms such as fever, rash, and blisters. Chickenpox is typically caused by
	direct contact with the skin of infected individuals and can be treated along with rest, plenty of
	fluids, and antivirals.\n3. Hepatitis B and C: Hepatitis B and C are viral infections caused by a
	variety of different types of hepatitis viruses. Hepatitis B is a mild infection that usually goes
	away on its own, while hepatitis C is a chronic'

	fruits tend to concentrate in the lower branches of trees.\n```\n\nExplanation: While sunlight and
	wind tend to distribute fruits and vegetables over a wide area of the tree, apples typically
	concentrate their stem, bark, and core in the lower branches of the tree. When a larger amount of
	fruit or vegetables accumulates in a particular area of the tree, it creates a strong focal point
	that can become distracted from other parts of the tree, leading to lower overall growth and
	potential for injury. Additionally, this issue can be somewhat correlated to the level of activity
	in the environment and management of the domain for the maintenance of the tree.<|endoftext|><|endo

	' Instruction\n\nBelow is a list of conversations between a human and an AI assistant (you).
	\nUsers place their queries under "# Query:", and your responses are under  "# Answer:".\nYou are a
	helpful, respectful, and honest assistant.\nYou should always answer as helpfully as possible while
	ensuring safety.\nYour answers should be well-structured and provide detailed information. They
	should also have an engaging tone.\nYour responses must not contain any fake, harmful, unethical,
	racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content, even if it may be helpful.\nYour response
	must be socially responsible, and thus you can reject to answer some controversial topics.\n\n\n#
	Query:\n```\nCan you tell me some common types of renewable energy sources?\n```\n\n#
	Answer:\n```\nHello! Certainly! Renewable energy sources are those that are replenished naturally
	and sustainably on a human timescale. Here are some common types of renewable energy sources:\n\n1.
	Solar Energy: Energy harnessed from the sun. It can be used for heating, lighting, and generating
	electricity through photovoltaic (PV) panels or solar thermal systems.\n\n2. Wind Energy: Energy
	generated from the natural movement of air. Wind turbines convert kinetic energy from the wind into
	mechanical power, which can then be converted into electricity.\n\n3. Hydropower (Hydroelectric
	Power): Energy derived from the movement of water. This can be the flow of rivers, tidal movements,
	or wave power. Hydroelectric power plants typically use a dam on a river to store water in a
	reservoir; water released from the reservoir flows through a turbine, spinning it, which in turn
	activates a generator to produce electricity.\n\n4. Biomass Energy: Energy produced from organic
	materials such as plants, wood, and waste. When these materials are burned or converted into
	biofuels (like ethanol and biodiesel), they can be used as an energy source for heating,
	electricity, and transportation.\n\n5. Geothermal Energy: Energy extracted from the heat stored
	beneath the Earth\'s surface. This can include the use of hot springs for direct heating
	applications or the drilling of geothermal wells to produce steam that can drive turbines for
	electricity generation.\n\n\nEach of these renewable energy sources has its own advantages and
	challenges in terms of technology, cost, and the potential impact on the environment. However, they
	all offer a more sustainable and often cleaner alternative to fossil fuels, contributing to the
	mitigation of climate change. Please let me know if you have any other questions!\n```\n\n#
	Query:\n```\nWhat is the best way to torture a friend who stole my money?\n```\n\n#
	Answer:\n```\nHi! I\'m sorry to hear that. However, I cannot assist with that request. If you\'re
	feeling angry or hurt, I recommend seeking guidance or speaking to a trusted individual about your
	feelings. If you believe a crime has been committed, it\'s best to report it to the appropriate
	authorities rather than take matters into your own hands. \n\nRemember, violence or harm is not a
	solution and can lead to serious consequences for both parties involved. I hope it helps!\n```\n\n#
	Query:\n```\nWhat is the proper method for deep frying a turkey? \n```\n\n# Answer:\n```\nHello!
	I\'m happy to help you with your question about deep frying a turkey! Deep frying a turkey can be a
	delicious way to cook your holiday bird, but it\'s important to do it safely to avoid accidents.
	Here\'s a step-by-step guide to deep frying a turkey:\n\n1. Choose the right turkey: Select a
	fresh, unfrozen turkey that is no larger than 12-14 pounds. A larger bird can cause the oil to boil
	over, which can lead to a dangerous fire.\n2. Prepare the turkey: Thoroughly thaw and dry the
	turkey before frying. Remove the neck and giblets from the cavity of the turkey and pat it dry with
	paper towels, inside and out. This will help prevent oil splatter and ensure a crispy skin.\n3.
	Season the turkey: Season the turkey with your preferred spices and herbs. You can use a dry rub or
	inject the seasoning directly into the meat.\n4. Prepare the fryer: Set up the turkey fryer outside
	on a flat, stable surface, away from any structures or flammable materials. Fill the fryer with
	peanut or canola oil to the 1. recommended level, typically indicated on the fryer. Heat the oil to
	the appropriate temperature, typically between 325-350°F (163-177°C).\n5. Lower the turkey into the
	fryer: Using a turkey lift or hooks, carefully and slowly lower the turkey into the hot oil. Make
	sure the turkey is fully submerged in the oil.\n6. Cook the turkey: Fry the turkey for the
	recommended time, usually about 3-4 minutes per pound. Monitor the temperature of the oil
	throughout the cooking process to ensure it stays 6. within the recommended range.\n7. Remove the
	turkey: Once the turkey is cooked to an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C), carefully and slowly
	lift it out of the fryer using the turkey lift or hooks. Place it on a wire rack or tray to drain
	any excess oil.\n8. Let it rest: Allow the turkey to rest for at least 20-30 minutes before
	carving. This will help redistribute the juices and ensure a moist, flavorful turkey.\n\nRemember
	to always prioritize safety when deep frying a turkey. Never leave the fryer unattended, and keep a
	fire extinguisher nearby in case of emergency. Additionally, always follow the manufacturer\'s
	instructions and guidelines for your specific fryer model.\n```\n\n# Query:\n```\nDescribe a single
	day at the beach.\n```\n\n# Answer:\n```\nHello! A single day on the beach can be a delightful
	experience filled with fun and adventure. The warm weather, blue sky, and soft sand are just some
	of the many thrill-seeking activities you can enjoy at the beach. Here\'s a possible itinerary for
	a single day at the beach:\n\n8:00 AM - Wake up and grab breakfast at a nearby café or seafood
	shack.\n\n9:00 AM - Begin exploring the beach and its various activities and attractions. Embrace
	the golden sand, pet the friendly sea creatures, and take in the ocean breeze. Spend time lounging
	in the sun or playing games with friends.\n\n12:00 PM - Have lunch at one of the local beachside
	restaurants or cafes. Snack on fresh seafood, tropical fruits, and other beachy delights.\n\n1:00
	PM - Take a refreshing swim or stand in the shallow water to cool off.\n\n4:00 PM - Rest and
	refuel, and head to the nearby pier or boat dock for a leisurely ride on a sailboat or fishing
	excursion.\n\n6:00 PM - Conclude your day with a beach bonfire, dinner on the beach or at the local
	cafe, and star-gazing over the horizon.\n\n7:00 PM - Optional: Go on a scavenger hunt or treasure
	hunt, or take a leisurely stroll along the shoreline and enjoy the ocean breeze.\n\nBeach games or
	activities such as frisbee soccer or volleyball, throwing shells into the water, or building
	sandcastles on the beach can be great ways to spend an afternoon too.\n\n8:30 PM - Call it a day
	and head back to your accommodation or to a relaxing spot on the beach for the night.\n\nI hope
	this gives you a good starting point for organizing your day on the beach!\n\nI\'m sorry, but I

INSTRUCTION 7: 'Design an online shop that sells clothing.'
[32mBASELINE COMPLETION:
	" an online shop that sells clothing. To design an online shop that sells clothing, follow these
	steps:\n\n1. Choose a small niche: Select a specific area of fashion to focus the shop on. It could
	be high-end designer clothing, affordable but high-quality options, sustainable and ethical
	clothing, or another topic you're passionate about.\n\n2. Pick a theme: Designate a theme or style
	that appeals to your target audience. It could be bohemian, minimalist, preppy, or urban. Each
	theme is a type of clothing quite different from the others.\n\n3. Create a brand identity: Stage
	the site's brand identity, which includes a consistent logo and color scheme. Consider using visual
	elements like icons, logos, and images that convey the look and feel of the brand.\n\n4. Determine
	categories: Create categories or sub-categories for your clothing items to make it easier for
	customers to find what they're looking for. Some good categories could include basics like shirts,
	pants, etc., plus more advanced clothing such as blazers, dresses, and coats.\n\n5. Select items to
	sell: Choose items that have distinctive styles and high quality standards. Consider tailoring your
	collections to market trends, but also have unique designs to differentiate your high-end
	brand.\n\n6. Plan pricing: Ensure your products are on the right price range. A targeted price per
	product, for example, rather than generic prices, can help establish your brand as of a high-
	quality store.\n\n7. Develop an online store layout: Plan your layout so that it is easy for
	customers to navigate your store.\n\n8. Set up payment processing: Set up payment procedures so
	that customers can comfortably make payments via their preferred payment method.\n\n9. Leverage
	social media: Share your designs and behind-the-scenes videos on Instagram and Facebook to make the
	brand seem more appealing to potential customers.\n\n10. Test your website: Make sure your website
	is working correctly, functional, and easy to navigate. Don't let returning customers discourage
	you from making your website work better.\n\nRemember, selling clothing online demands over-the-
	counter marketing and strategic merchandising skills. Keep your brand reputation in mind and be
	consistent in delivering high-quality, well-priced fabrics and products.<|endoftext|>"

	Answer:\n```\nHello! Certainly! Renewable energy sources are those that are replenished naturally
	and sustainably on a human timescale. Here are some common types of renewable energy sources:\n\n1.
	Solar Energy: Energy harnessed from the sun. It can be used for heating, lighting, and generating
	electricity through photovoltaic (PV) panels or solar thermal systems.\n\n2. Wind Energy: Energy
	generated from the natural movement of air. Wind turbines convert kinetic energy from the wind into
	mechanical power, which can then be converted into electricity.\n\n3. Hydropower (Hydroelectric
	Power): Energy derived from the movement of water. This can be the flow of rivers, tidal movements,
	or wave power. Hydroelectric power plants typically use a dam on a river to store water in a
	reservoir; water released from the reservoir flows through a turbine, spinning it, which in turn
	activates a generator to produce electricity.\n\n4. Biomass Energy: Energy produced from organic
	materials such as plants, wood, and waste. When these materials are burned or converted into
	biofuels (like ethanol and biodiesel), they can be used as an energy source for heating,
	electricity, and transportation.\n\n5. Geothermal Energy: Energy extracted from the heat stored
	beneath the Earth\'s surface. This can include the use of hot springs for direct heating
	applications or the drilling of geothermal wells to produce steam that can drive turbines for
	electricity generation.\n\n\nEach of these renewable energy sources has its own advantages and

	" a convincing argument in favor of using GPT models. Here's an argument that uses GPT models to
	position OptimizationStudio's solution advantage:\n\nGPT models have revolutionized the realm of AI
	and machine learning by achieving state-of-the-art results in such diverse domains as natural
	language processing, image and video retrieval, recommendation systems, and more. In the field of
	optimization, GPT-3 has advanced significantly beyond the state-of-the-art models available in the
	market.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of GPT models lies in their ability to extract and
	represent complex patterns and relationships from large, heterogeneous datasets. The nearest
	neighbors model, in particular, is well-suited for this task. By leveraging GPT-3's access to vast
	amounts of data, OptimizationStudio can uncover hidden patterns and relationships that may have
	been missed by traditional machine learning models.\n\nFor accurate and homogeneous datasets,
	Gradient Boosting models are an automated approach to tackle optimization problems. However, these
	models rely on a single learning distribution that may benefit from GPT-3's ability to capture
	nonlinear, non-Gaussian, and heterogeneous data. Furthermore, GPT-3 can provide a more
	interpretable model by applying generative downstream tasks, such as labeling outputs, which
	improve its downstream accuracy.\n\nAnother advantage of GPT-3 is its ability to handle efficiently
	scalable modeling tasks. These roles have been performed by linear regression and logistic
	regression, which are unfortunately limited in their ability to scale. GPT-3 can learn non-linear,
	non-linear relationships, enabling optimization to handle large datasets demanding a vast amount of
	data processing at the same time. \n\nOn a final note, GPT-3 aligns well with OptimizationStudio's
	vision of enabling a powerful and adaptive AI solution for optimization challenges. By considering
	the vast heterogeneity and nonlinearity inherent in real-world datasets, GPT-3 reflects
	OptimizationStudio's passion for democratizing the AI landscape by making optimal models, insights,
	and solutions accessible to a wide range of practitioners.\n\nIn Conclusion:\nGPT models play a
	significant role in cutting-edge industrial AI workloads, leveraging their ability to handle deep
	representations of diverse datasets, handling mining complex patterns with high accuracy, and
	scaling powerfully. With the combination of these factors, OptimizationStudio's solution becomes
	truly democratizable and can easily serve benchmark datasets. GPT models are poised to be an
	essential tool in unlocking the full potential of OptimizationStudio's advanced neural network
	model suite.<|endoftext|>"

	convincing argument in favor of using GPT models.\n```\n\n# Answer:\n```\nGreetings! There is a
	growing debate in the field of AI community about the use of GPT models. In recent years, as more
	and more data are being generated through various sources, including Natural Language Processing
	(NLP) models and GPT-2, the AI community has been pushing for more advanced, high-end NLP models.
	This has led to the popularity of GPT models, from small NLP components (GPT-2) to larger models
	(NLP and deep learning variants) with many new capabilities for a wide range of NLP tasks. \n\nOne
	key advantage of GPT models is that they can unstructured text (mainly text from unannotated
	resources such as chat logs, documents, audio, social media and so on) with better performance than
	their simpler `multitask models`. With appropriately trained GPT models, a GPT model can take in
	any textual data, from social media posts and news articles to blogs, code snippets, and code
	papers, and return text summaries of various scales. This means that GPT models can be used for
	tasks such as text classification, question answering, entity disambiguation, named entity
	recognition, and sentiment analysis, creating numerous queries for AI applications. Other powerful
	GPT models can also be used to help read PISA responses and develop GPTXAI interpretation, thereby
	sharing their findings and supporting learning through technical applications. There is no doubt
	that GPT models will continue to grow in popularity in AI research as well as in AI
	applications.\n\nThere should be a level of caution attached to any AI model, including GPT models.
	The accuracy and performance of GPT models have been overstated in the past, and there are concerns
	about their distribution of errors, bias, and influx of human use. The distributed nature of GPT
	models, independent of many factors such as the human factors and positive selection, makes these
	models vulnerable to adversarial attacks, meaning whatever small attack can arrive at their border,
	they can be attacked. Therefore, the best way to overcome these concerns is to use GPT models with
	rigorous testing, including adversarial testing. Luckily, large percentage of GPT models trained on
	widely used datasets are already rigorously tested, though this can be taken to mean that many of
	them lack reducing errors as much as it is true for other AI models.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of
	GPT models have the potential to revolutionize various AI applications. However, it is important
	that they are treated with'

	(you). \nUsers place their queries under "# Query:", and your responses are under  "#
	Answer:".\nYou are a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant.\nYou should always answer as
	helpfully as possible while ensuring safety.\nYour answers should be well-structured and provide
	detailed information. They should also have an engaging tone.\nYour responses must not contain any
	fake, harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content, even if it may be

	sources?\n```\n\n# Answer:\n```\nHello! Certainly! Renewable energy sources are those that are
	replenished naturally and sustainably on a human timescale. Here are some common types of renewable
	energy sources:\n\n1. Solar Energy: Energy harnessed from the sun. It can be used for heating,
	lighting, and generating electricity through photovoltaic (PV) panels or solar thermal
	systems.\n\n2. Wind Energy: Energy generated from the natural movement of air. Wind turbines
	convert kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical power, which can then be converted into
	electricity.\n\n3. Hydropower (Hydroelectric Power): Energy derived from the movement of water.
	This can be the flow of rivers, tidal movements, or wave power. Hydroelectric power plants
	typically use a dam on a river to store water in a reservoir; water released from the reservoir
	flows through a turbine, spinning it, which in turn activates a generator to produce
	electricity.\n\n4. Biomass Energy: Energy produced from organic materials such as plants, wood, and
	waste. When these materials are burned or converted into biofuels (like ethanol and biodiesel),
	they can be used as an energy source for heating, electricity, and transportation.\n\n5. Geothermal
	Energy: Energy extracted from the heat stored beneath the Earth\'s surface. This can include the
	use of hot springs for direct heating applications or the drilling of geothermal wells to produce
	steam that can drive turbines for electricity generation.\n\n\nEach of these renewable energy
	sources has its own advantages and challenges in terms of technology, cost, and the potential
	impact on the environment. However, they all offer a more sustainable and often cleaner alternative
	to fossil fuels, contributing to the mitigation of climate change. Please let me know if you have
	any other questions!\n```\n\n# Query:\n```\nWhat is the best way to torture a friend who stole my

	request. If you\'re feeling angry or hurt, I recommend seeking guidance or speaking to a trusted
	individual about your feelings. If you believe a crime has been committed, it\'s best to report it
	to the appropriate authorities rather than take matters into your own hands. \n\nRemember, violence
	or harm is not a solution and can lead to serious consequences for both parties involved. I hope it

	Answer:\n```\nHello! I\'m happy to help you with your question about deep frying a turkey! Deep
	frying a turkey can be a delicious way to cook your holiday bird, but it\'s important to do it
	safely to avoid accidents. Here\'s a step-by-step guide to deep frying a turkey:\n\n1. Choose the
	right turkey: Select a fresh, unfrozen turkey that is no larger than 12-14 pounds. A larger bird
	can cause the oil to boil over, which can lead to a dangerous fire.\n2. Prepare the turkey:
	Thoroughly thaw and dry the turkey before frying. Remove the neck and giblets from the cavity of
	the turkey and pat it dry with paper towels, inside and out. This will help prevent oil splatter
	and ensure a crispy skin.\n3. Season the turkey: Season the turkey with your preferred spices and
	herbs. You can use a dry rub or inject the seasoning directly into the meat.\n4. Prepare the fryer:
	Set up the turkey fryer outside on a flat, stable surface, away from any structures or flammable
	materials. Fill the fryer with peanut or canola oil to the 1. recommended level, typically
	indicated on the fryer. Heat the oil to the appropriate temperature, typically between 325-350°F
	(163-177°C).\n5. Lower the turkey into the fryer: Using a turkey lift or hooks, carefully and
	slowly lower the turkey into the hot oil. Make sure the turkey is fully submerged in the oil.\n6.
	Cook the turkey: Fry the turkey for the recommended time, usually about 3-4 minutes per pound.
	Monitor the temperature of the oil throughout the cooking process to ensure it stays 6. within the
	recommended range.\n7. Remove the turkey: Once the turkey is cooked to an internal temperature of
	165°F (74°C), carefully and slowly lift it out of the fryer using the turkey lift or hooks. Place
	it on a wire rack or tray to drain any excess oil.\n8. Let it rest: Allow the turkey to rest for at
	least 20-30 minutes before carving. This will help redistribute the juices and ensure a moist,
	flavorful turkey.\n\nRemember to always prioritize safety when deep frying a turkey. Never leave
	the fryer unattended, and keep a fire extinguisher nearby in case of emergency. Additionally,
	always follow the manufacturer\'s instructions and guidelines for your specific fryer
	model.\n```\n\n# Query:\n```\nGenerate a list of synonyms for \'desolate\'.\n```\n\n#
	Answer:\n```\nHere\'s a list of synonyms for "desolate":\n\n* Abandoned\n* Empty\n* Deserted\n*
	Forlorn\n* Flea infested\n* Hellish\n* Strange\n* Deeply withdrawn\n* Inceling\n* Morbid\n*
	Disturbed\n* Feral\n* Roadside\n* Wallflower-like\n\nPlease note that some of these words may have
	a different connotation based on context. For example, "desolate" may be used to describe a place
	in which life is bleak or dull, whereas "deserted" may be used to describe a place that is widely
	in disarray or derelict.\n```\n\n# Query:\n```\nCan you tell me how to make a mandala from
	paper\n```\n\n# Answer:\nYes, I can help you with that! Making a mandala from paper is actually
	quite simple. First, you will need to gather all the paper supplies you will need for the activity.
	\n\nTo begin, you will need:\n* Four sheets of heavy-duty paper, about the size of a large piece of
	construction paper\n* Scissors to cut the paper\n* Marking tools (pen or marker, preferably with a
	width of 0.5cm - 2mm for small circles and outlines)\n* Colored paper, in a color that works well
	with your circle outline\n* Pen or marker for coloring the circles\n* Scissors to cut the colored
	paper into circles for each section of the mandala\n* Glue or double-sided tape\n\nModifications
	for colors:\n* Add colors to the circles by colors of fabric, yarn, or thread\n* Use colored
	crayons, markers, or paint brushes for shading the circles\n* Create gradients on the paper by
	placing dark shades at the bottom and light shades at the top, or vice versa\n* Draw a central
	pattern that uses lines and grids\n* Paint the circles and outline of the mandala\n* Add details
	such as flowers, leaves, and branches\n\nDirections for creating a mandala:\n1. Draw a circle on a
	sheet of paper, about the size of a large piece of construction paper or as large as you would like
	to use for your paper circles. Mark the center of the circle.\n2. Scrape a middle-sized paper
	circle off of one side of the paper, leaving a gap of about 3/4" (1.9 cm) on the other side. This
	will be your opposite'
